## Project Title:

Muzak

## Motivation:

My motivation for Muzak was to create a service that I would like to use myself: providing personalized music recommendations to users based on their preferences. I've always enjoyed the various ways that streaming services such as Pandora and Spotify provide recommendations, so I modeled this app off of Last.fm's algorithm.

## Technology Used:

Redux, Semantic UI, Custom CSS

### Built With:

React and Ruby on Rails

### Features:

User can create a username to log in and out. Once logged in, the user can search for any artist (pulling from Last.fm's API), and play the most-played YouTube video for that artist (pulling from YouTube's API). Once the user saves the artist to their profile, the app will recommend five further artists for listening.
